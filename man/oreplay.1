.SH NAME
olist, oshow, oreplay \- query the OLC server
.SH SYNOPSIS
olist [-f filename] [-s server] [-r]

oshow [-f filename] [-s server] [-n] username [instance]

oreplay [-f filename] [-s server] username [instance]
.SH DESCRIPTION
These commands are used to query the OLC server about items in its database.
Respectively, they retrieve the current queue listing, the new messages for
a user, and the complete log for a user.

The commands understand the following options:
.TP 12
.B \-f \f filename\fR
specifies a file to put the output of the command in.  If this is not
specified, the default is stdout.
.TP
.B \-s \f server\fR
specifies the hostname of the server to contact.

Additionally, these flags are understood by specific commands:
.TP 12
.B \-r
specifies that the output should be in ``raw'' (unprocessed) format,
which is easily parsed in a script or program.
.TP
.B \-n
specifies that the new messages retrieve should be marked as seen on the
server.

.SH LOGS
Logs of conversations are kept on the daemon's home machine.  They are for
the use of consultants, volunteers, and Athena staff members only; they
are not made public. 
.SH VOLUNTEERS
Users interested in becoming OLC volunteers should send mail to
.B oconsult@athena.mit.edu.
The OLC Manager will reply by mail.
