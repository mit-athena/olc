.SH NAME
olcr \- on-line consulting reply program
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBolcr \fR[\fBrequest\fR]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
OLC is a system which queues users' questions and mediates transactions
between the users and consultants.
.I Olcr
is the program used by consultants to answer questions from users using
.I olc.
.I Olcr 
provides many of the same commands for consultants and volunteers as
.I olc
gives to users, as well as additional commands available only to
consultants and volunteers.
.PP
The optional \fBrequest\fR after the command allows the issuing of a
single \fBolcr\fR request without entering the command loop.  Any
arguments following the request-command will be passed to the
subcommand.
.PP
For information on the available commands, type "?" or "help" while
inside
.I olcr.
.PP
The daemon uses Zephyr(1) for sending messages. If the user is not  
subscribing to personal messages, the daemon will send messages via
write(1).
Therefore, users must have messages on (\fBmesg y\fR) to use
.I olc
if they are not using Zephyr.
.PP
To insure the privacy of other OLC conversations, Kerberos(1) authentication
is required to ask a question. OLC should print a lengthy friendly error 
message in cases of authentication failure. 
.PP
All commands and most options may be specified by a unique initial string.
