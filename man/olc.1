.SH NAME
olc \- allows you to ask a consultant for help
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/athena/olc \fR[\fBrequest\fR]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
On-Line Consulting (OLC) is a system which enables users to get help
from consultants or volunteers.  When a user types
.I olc,
he is placed in a subsystem which allows him to browse answers to common
questions, or ask a consultant a question.
.PP
If the user types "ask",
.I olc
asks for a one-word description of the question, called a 'topic'.
Typing a "?" at this prompt gives a list of the valid topics.  This
topic allows OLC to find a consultant who knows something about that
part of the system.  After the user has selected a topic,
.I olc
prompts him for a question, and tries to find a consultant who is
available to answer questions.  If there is one, the user and the
consultant receive messages saying they have been connected.  At this
point, the user and the consultant can exchange messages by using the
"send" command.  There may be some delay between messages as the
consultant composes a response.  A user can temporarily exit from
.I olc
at any point, but the question is terminated only when she uses either
the "done" or "cancel" command, or when the consultant types "done".
.PP
For information on the available commands, type "?" or "help" while
inside
.I olc.
.PP
If the
.B request
is supplied on the command line, it is used as the only request to be
executed, rather than entering the request loop.  E.g., "olc show"
will show new messages, but will leave the user at the shell prompt.
.PP
OLC uses Zephyr(1) for sending messages. If the user is not  
subscribing to personal messages, the daemon will send messages via
write(1).
Therefore, users must have messages on (\fBmesg y\fR) to use
.I olc
if they are not using Zephyr.
.PP
Kerberos(1) authentication is required to ask a question. OLC should
print a lengthy friendly error message in cases of authentication
failure.
.SH LOGS
Logs of conversations are kept on the daemon's home machine.  They are for
the use of consultants, volunteers, and Athena staff members only; they
are not made public. 
.SH VOLUNTEERS
Users interested in becoming OLC volunteers should send mail to
.B oconsult@athena.mit.edu.
The OLC Manager will reply by mail.

.SH BUGS
If a user's terminal cannot receive messages and not subscribing to Zephyr
notifications, the OLC server will believe the user has logged out.
