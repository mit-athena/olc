XOLC is the X-based version of OLC, the "On-Line Consulting" program at
Project Athena.  Using OLC, a user can ask a question of a consultant or
a volunteer via the computer.  The user and consultant can be anywhere
on network, which makes it very convenient for both.  If there are no
consultants avavilable when a question is asked, the OLC Daemon will
hold the question until one is available.  The Daemon also stores the
questions while they are passed from consultant to consultant.

In order to fully compile this program, you need the following things:

	(1) An OLC daemon, and the source code for it.  This program
uses include files from the OLC source code.  Once built and run, it
will attempt to contact the OLC daemon -- therefore you will want to get
the sources for the daemon and install one.  OLC sources should be
available soon.

	(2) Hesiod name service.  The program determines the location of
the OLC daemon via Hesiod name lookup.  Hesiod should be available to
the public, I believe.  OLC and XOLC can be compiled without hesiod,
however.  A compile flag is provided for this; see the makefile.

	(3) Kerberos authentication service.  The program uses the
kerberos authentication service, which is available to the public now.
OLC and XOLC can be compiled without hesiod, however.  A compile flag is
provided for this; see the makefile.

	(4) Zephyr message transport system.  This program does not
directly use zephyr, however, the OLC daemon does.  Again, OLC can be
compiled without it, and in it's abscence, relies on Unix "write" to
notify the user and/or consultant about new messages from the other
party.


** HOWEVER **, should you wish to see the XOLC interface without any of
the 4 components mentioned above, you can compile an "interface-only"
version of XOLC.  The makefile is set up to compile this way by default;
should you wish to compile a real version, make the changes suggested in
the makefile.

In the "interface-only" version, every attempt has been made to make the
interface "feel" as similar to the real working product, and to expose
the user to as much of the interface as possible without actually
connecting to the OLC daemon.

Another note about compiling...  this code assumes that you have an ANSI
C compiler, such as gcc or hc (on the IBM RT).  If you do not, you will
not want to include "Mu.h" in xolc.h.

The program is not yet complete, though it is close.  The help files are
lacking, and there are most probably bugs that have not yet been
discovered.
