This directory contains the sources for the OLC On-Line Consulting
system.  It is set up to configure via Autoconf.  If you're not on
Athena, you should first edit include/site.h with appropriate
definitions.  You should then be able to simply say "./configure" then
"make" in order to build everything.  "make install" will install the
binaries.

OLC currently relies on several Athena services, including Hesiod,
Kerberos, and Zephyr.  If your system does not have these services,
the configure script should do the right thing and give you a
configuration that won't use those services.  This has not been tested
recently, though, so it may not build entirely cleanly.  In addition,
the build may not currently work on a non-POSIX system.  Eit.

Please send comments, suggestions, bug-fixes, questions, etc.  to
"info-olc@athena.mit.edu".  For copyright, copying, and distribution
information, see the file "mit-copyright.h" in the include subdirectory.
