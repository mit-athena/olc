This directory contains the sources for the OLC On-Line Consulting
system.  It is set up to use imake to
Makefiles for the entire tree and to make dependencies and build all of
the executables, you should be able to simpley say "make world" and it
will do the right thing.

OLC currently relies on several Athena services, including Hesiod,
Kerberos, and Zephyr.  If your system does not have these services, you
should be able to get around them by undef'ing the appropriate #define.
This has not been tested recently, though, so it may not build entirely
cleanly.

Please send comments, suggestions, bug-fixes, questions, etc.  to
"info-olc@athena.mit.edu".  For copyright, copying, and distribution
information, see the file "mit-copyright.h" in the include subdirectory.
